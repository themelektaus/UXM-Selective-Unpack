# UXM Selective Unpacker  
Enables file modding for DS1, DS2, SotFS, DS3, Sekiro and Elden Ring by unpacking game archives and patching the executable to load loose files instead.    
Requires [.NET 4.7.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/net472) - Windows 10 users should already have this.    
[Nexus Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/1651)    

# Usage  
When first starting the app, the default Steam location of Sekiro will be selected. If the game you want is installed somewhere else, use the Browse button to correct it.  

The Unpack button will extract all files from the game archives, unless you select files in the "View Files" menu.  

Any files you select with "View Files" will be the only files unpacked, if you have the "Use Selected Files" checkbox checked (Which will be checked for you if you hit "OK" in the "View Files" menu).  

The Patch button will modify the executable to use those extracted files instead of looking in the archives; please note that for Sekiro, most users should use Mod Engine instead of patching. Patching the executable without also unpacking the archives will crash the game, so make sure you do both.  

Finally, the Restore button will restore the original executable and delete the extracted files, and the Abort button will cancel any operation in progress.  

# Bannability
UXM only edits data within the executable, not code, so anticheat should have no effect on it. File mods in general have never been grounds for a ban in any of the Souls games, but mods that alter your save may not be safe, so please consult your mod author's advice and play offline if using anything dubious.  

Elden Ring  
You cannot play online with an modified exe, so you cannot go online with an unpacked game (Nor can you go online with Mod Engine 2)
